# Attendance-Automation
This project is an automated Google Apps Script solution for robustly updating a master attendance register from raw attendance files (Excel/Sheets) in Google Drive. It is designed for online EdTech bootcamps/classes, handling common edge cases like flexible tab names, participant nickname matching, and safe merging.
